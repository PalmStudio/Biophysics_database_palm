# LiDAR Data

The archive `LiDAR_data.zip` contains the LiDAR data for the four plants. 

Each folder inside the archive is a measurement session were we scanned all four plants with a Riegl VZ400. The data here are the point clouds extracted from the raw data. The raw data are not included here for disk space reasons (44 Go). The raw data can be sent upon request.

The archive `reconstructions.zip` contains the meshes reconstructed from the point clouds.
