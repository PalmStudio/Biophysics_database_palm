# Walz measurements

This folder contains data acquired using a Walz GFS-3000 portable gas exchange system. The data is compressed into a `tar.bz2` archive that consists on a set of CSV files with the following naming convention: `P<Plant ID>F<Leaf ID><month (double digit)><day (double digit)>.csv`. So a file named `P1F20129.csv` correspond to the data acquired on the 29th of January 2021 for the second leaf of the first plant.

Inside each CSV file, the columns correspond to:
