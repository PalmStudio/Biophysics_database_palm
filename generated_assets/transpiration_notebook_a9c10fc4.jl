# Plant transpiration

The weight of the potted plant inside the measurement chamber (`mic3`) was continuously monitored using a connected precision scale. The pot and soil were isolated using a plastic bag, so any change in the pot weight was due to the plant transpiration (+/- the saturation inside the bag).

The transpiration was measured in five phases due to changes in the measurement setup:

- phase 0, from 09/03/2021 to 10/03/2021, logged in the file `Weights_1.txt`. In this phase we used a regular computer with a script that read the data from the scale (1000C-3000D) for one minute, and logged its average onto the computer. The DateTime is in UTC+1.
- phase 1, from 2021-03-10T15:08:23 to 2021-03-15T14:49:06, file `weightsPhase1.txt`. We changed computers to use one from the Ecotron, which was arounbd UTC-4min.
- phase 2, from 2021-03-15T15:46:13 to 2021-03-27T01:19:27, file `weightsPhase2.txt`. In this measurement phase, we changed the script to log the data every second, without any averaging as we decided it is better to log the raw data and make the average afterward. The DateTime should be close to UTC. This data collection end the day before the day-time change. Data is lost for the weekend (after 2021-03-27T01:19:27) because the weight of the plant was above the maximum capacity of the scale.
- phase 3, from 2021-03-30T09:45:01 to 2021-04-08T07:03:59, file `weightsPhase3.txt`. This phase is the same as phase 3, there is just a data gap because we were investigating why data logging was not working anymore (we didn't see any error on the scale).
- phase 4, from 2021-04-07T10:46:19 to 2021-05-02T06:49:33, file `weightsPhase4.txt`. We received the new precision scale (XB3200C) that we just bought (we borrowed the first one). So in this phase we changed the scale, and also installed a Raspberry Pi to log the data. The Raspberry Pi is connected to the scale via USB, and the data is logged every second. We measured a lag in the DateTime of around 1 day, 47 minutes and 12 seconds compared to UTC (Raspberry: 2021-04-12T13:02:43 ; Thermal camera: 20210413_144827_R.jpg, with a delay of 3512s, so 2021-04-13T13:49:55 UTC)

To be sure to get the same time for all the data, we used the time of the thermal camera, which we know have a constant delay of 3512s compared to UTC. The method was to use the thermal images to see when there is a change of plant, because its weight goes down near 0.0 at this time, with a maximum error of 60s, because the images where taken each minute.

We use the `time_synchronization.csv` file to synchronize correctly the timestamps.
