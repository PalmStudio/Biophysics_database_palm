Tair : Air temperature (C)

VPD : The vapour pressure deficit of the air (i.e. not the leaf-to-air VPD) (kPa)

Wind : Wind speed (m s-1)

WleafLeaf width (m) : StomatalRatioThe stomatal ratio (cf. Licor6400 terminology),
if it is 1,  leaves have stom-ata only on one side (hypostomatous),
2 for leaves with stomata on both sides(amphistomatous).
LeafAbs : Leaf absorptance of solar radiation (0-1).
RH : The relative humidity of the air (i.e.  not calculated with leaf temperature) (inpercent).

... : Further parameters passed toPhotosyn.  Note that Tleaf is not allowed as an input,
since that is calculated by PhotosynEB from energy balance.

gs : ForFindTleaf, the stomatal conductance (mol m-2 s-1).
