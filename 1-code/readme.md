This folder contains all scripts made to synthetise, treat, generate or analyse data generated in "Ecotron2021\0-data\".
In each file, the aim of the script, the author, and the date are present in the header.
After treatment, generated data can appear in \0-data\ and will be sorted by type of data (1-climate, 2-CO2, 3-transpiration, 4-thermal_camera_measurement, 5-walz, 6-picarro_flux, 7-scenarios).
If it is a final product (like the big synthetised .csv or graphics made for conceptual representation), it will appear in "Ecotron2021\2-output" rather than in \0-data\.
